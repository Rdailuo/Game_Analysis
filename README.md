# Mobile Game Success Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of the highest-grossing mobile games to identify factors contributing to their success. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), estimation of game industry KPIs (e.g., DAU, MAU, ARPU, retention rates), a simulated A/B test, and data-driven recommendations for game designers and marketing teams. The project was created to demonstrate my skills in data analytics for a Data Analytics Intern role in the gaming industry.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on mobile games that have grossed at least $1 billion in revenue, including game name, publisher, category, release year, and global sales.  
**Credit:** The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle - Highest Grossing Mobile Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadatkhalid/highest-grossing-mobile-games-dataset?resource=download).

## Project Structure
- **Notebook:** `Mobile_Game_Success_Analysis.ipynb` - A Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including data cleaning, EDA, KPI estimation, A/B testing, visualizations, and recommendations.
- **Outputs:** Visualizations include revenue trends, estimated DAU by category, top publishers, and A/B test results.

## Key Features
- **EDA:** Analyzed revenue trends by game category, publisher, and release period.
- **KPI Estimation:** Estimated DAU, MAU, ARPU, and retention rates using industry benchmarks.
- **A/B Testing:** Simulated an A/B test to optimize an in-game purchase offer, improving conversion rates and revenue.
- **Visualizations:** Created bar charts and boxplots to present insights, mimicking a dashboard approach.
- **Recommendations:** Provided actionable insights for game designers and marketing teams to improve player engagement and monetization.
